			When using Components, camelCasing used in the name of the component or in the name of its bindings translates into camel-casing in the markup and attributes.

				&lthero&gt is a simple component. Its attribute receives a string.

			<dh-zone-example-note>
				This block uses the component &ltdh-editable-field&gt. mainHero is passed through its field-value attribute. field-value has a one-way binding, &lt. The changes made to mainHero in the component do not reflect back to MainController.

				This is hero1.vMainController:
				<br>
				{{hero1}}

				The list of heroes resides in the &ltdh-hero-list&gt controller.
				<br>
				Data is sent from parent to descendant component, one way, through the binding. Component modifies data and sends it back to parent.
				<br>
				Parent determines what to do with the modified data (further modify it, apply it to the model, etc).
				<br>
				For example: Use "Seattle" as the Location. The &ltdh-editable-field&gt component first records the change to "Seattle". However, it doesn' change the &ltdh-hero-detail&gt; model. Through an event, it sends "Seattle" up to &ltdh-hero-detail&gt;. &ltdh-hero-detail&gt; controller has business logic that modifies the location to "Starbucks City". &ltdh-hero-detail&gt; sends that up to the list component. The list component has no idea that the location was ever "Seattle". It receives "Starbucks City". &lt;dh-hero-list&gt; applies the change to its model - the highest structure to hold the list data. The upward cascading of data through events stops there.

				Directives can require the controllers of other directives to enable cross-directive communication. This is achieved through the <b>require</b> property which creates an object mapping between a property key (local required controller name) and property value (name of component with the required controllers)
				<br>
				Note that the required controllers will not be available during the instantiation of the controller, but they are guaranteed to be available just before the $onInit method is executed!
