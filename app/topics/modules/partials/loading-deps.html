		<p>A module is a collection of configuration and run blocks which get applied to the application during the bootstrap process.</p>
		<p>In its simplest form, the module consists of a collection of two kinds of blocks:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Configuration blocks:</b>
				These get executed during the provider registrations and configuration phase. Only providers and constants can be injected into the configuration blocks. This prevents accidental instantiation of services before they have been fully configured.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Run blocks:</b>
				These get executed after the injector is created and are used to kickstart the application. Only instances and constants can be injected into run blocks. This is to prevent further system configuration during application run time.
			</li>
		</ul>
